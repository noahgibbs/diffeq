* http://diffeq.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

The DiffEQ package is for symbolic calculation with formulas in time,
and for setup and integration of systems of Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs).

It's written in pure Ruby, and is designed for easy of use, not for
performance on large systems.

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install diffeq

== SYNOPSIS:

require "diffeq"

require "ftools"      # for File.exist?

PLOTTERFILE = "volterra.yaml"

varset = DiffEQ::VarSet.new

advancer = DiffEQ::Advancer.new(varset)

File.delete(PLOTTERFILE) if File.exist?(PLOTTERFILE)

# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka-Volterra_equation, see volterra.rb for details.

preyvar = varset.add_variable("x", "")

predvar = varset.add_variable("y", "")

# These are initial populations of predator and prey

preyvar.add_known(0.0, 30.0)

predvar.add_known(0.0, 4.0)

alpha = 1.0

beta = 0.2

delta = 0.3

gamma = 0.8

# Set derivatives for variables x and y

varset.add_variable("x_D1", "#{alpha} * x - #{beta} * x * y")

varset.add_variable("y_D1", "#{delta} * x * y - #{gamma} * y")

# This does the integration from t=0 to t=100, and writes the values to a file

advancer.calculate

advancer.start_plotter

yzero = advancer.get_yzero_values

values, yvec = advancer.advance(values, yvec, 0.0, 100.0)

advancer.write_plotter_file(PLOTTERFILE)

advancer.stop_plotter
